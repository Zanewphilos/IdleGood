**Backgroud and Motivation**

With the cost of living rising significantly in recent years, there is a growing tendency to look for solutions to cut back on expenses in order to achieve a more sustainable lifestyle. This economic pressure has prompted consumers to turn to the second-hand market for more affordable shopping options. This trend is clearly reflected in the sales figures of second-hand trading platforms. For example, second-hand trading platforms like Vinted have seen sales increase by 51 % in the most recent year, a growth rate that far exceeds that of many traditional retailers. Amazon has also reported significant growth in its used goods sales, up 15 % in the first nine months of 2023, with sales in the European and UK markets totalling £1bn. (Butler, 2023) According to a Statista report, as many as 40 % of US consumers have used a second-hand trading platform in 2022, and the US online resale market is expected to reach $100 billion in transactions by 2027 (2022). These phenomena not only reflect consumers' quest for affordable and sustainable lifestyles, but also reveal the booming potential of the secondhand market in the current economic climate.

In this regard, in the international university campus community, students come from all over the world and,  may travel to other cities or countries to continue their careers or academic pursuits after completing their studies and research project. This mobility means that students may leave behind many items they no longer need when they leave campus, such as textbooks, electronic devices, furniture and other household items. While there is a high demand for second-hand items on campus, students as a more price-sensitive group of people in general(Pettinger, 2017), primarily transfer items through social networking platforms (e.g., chat app groups), a process that is often inefficient due to incomplete information (e.g., no prices indicated) or a lack of immediate updates on the status of items sold. Therefore, the development of a second-hand trading application that focuses on the campus market can provide a centralised and accessible platform for buyers and sellers to discover each other's demand and supply, a convenient and fast way for students leaving campus to dispose of their unused items, and an economic convenience for community members staying on campus.
